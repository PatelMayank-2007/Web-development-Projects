<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Patel Mayank, and I am currently a second-semester student pursuing a B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Design at G H Patel College of Engineering and Technology. I have a strong interest in software development and a deep curiosity about how technology shapes the world around us. As part of my journey to become a skilled developer, I am currently learning full-stack web development through Angela Yuâ€™s highly-rated course, which is helping me understand the core concepts of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and other essential technologies. Alongside this, I am also focused on strengthening my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking by studying Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through the Alpha 3.0 program by Shraddha Didi, which is known for its clear and structured teaching approach.</p>

<p>Academically, I completed my 12th grade from Knowledge High School in Nadiad, where I scored 82%, and my 10th grade from English Teaching School, also in Nadiad, achieving an impressive 92%. These experiences laid a strong academic foundation and instilled in me a habit of consistent learning and discipline
</p>

<p>I am passionate about coding, designing efficient solutions, and continuously exploring new tools and technologies in the field of computer science. My goal is to become a versatile software engineer who can contribute to real-world projects and build impactful digital products. I believe in lifelong learning and am always excited to take on new challenges that help me grow both personally and professionally.</p>
